100. Same Tree

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:

Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

Output: true
Example 2:

Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]

Output: false
Example 3:

Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   1     1   2

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]

Output: false

Solution:
There are 4 cases we need to check recursively:

1. p is None and q is None: return True
2. p is None and q is not None: return False
3. p is not None and q is None: return False
4. p.val != q.val: return False
Runtime: O(N) for looking at every element in the tree
Space: O(N): Recursive Call stack
