169. Majority Element

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Solution:
Simply iterate through the array and have a hash map or dictionary that has the element has keys and the frequency as values

In example 1 we would have:
{
	3: 2
	2: 1
}

In example 2:
{
	2: 4
	1: 3
}

THen iterate through the hash map and find the maximum value and return that key.

Runtime: O(N)
Space: O(N)
